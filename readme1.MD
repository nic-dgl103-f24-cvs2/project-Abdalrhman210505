# JavaScript Website Enhancement Project

## Website Overview
This project enhances an existing HTML/CSS-based website that features a modern layout and an image gallery. The goal of the enhancements is to improve user experience and interactivity using JavaScript.

## Features Added
1. **Modal Image Viewer**: When a user clicks on a gallery image, it opens in a larger view with a dark overlay.
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Users can use arrow keys to navigate between images and `Escape` to close the modal.
3. **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in and fade-out transitions are used when opening and closing the modal to enhance the visual experience.
