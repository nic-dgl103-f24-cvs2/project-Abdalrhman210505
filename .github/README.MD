# Kehler Vegetables Farm Website Redesign

I have chosen to redesign the website for [Kehler Vegetables Farm](https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/), located in Black Creek.

## 1. Client Needs for This Website

- **Objective**: The client requires a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate website with a responsive design that adapts well to different viewports.
- **Target Audience**: Local residents near Black Creek who enjoy spending quality time at a local farm.
- **Message**: The website aims to encourage families to visit the farm, enjoy the atmosphere, and purchase fresh produce.
- Additionally, it should showcase the quality of the farm’s produce, services, and available activities.
- **Current Site Issues**: The existing website isn’t optimized for various viewports and does not create a positive impression, which may deter potential visitors. for example there is no optimized menu for the mobile phone veiw port .



## 2. Design Elements

- **Mood**: The goal is to create a clean, visually appealing website that encourages customers to buy fresh produce from the farm.
- **Inspiration**:  
  - [Winsom Farm](https://www.winsomfarm.ca/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6ZuQLAXp9FOIxOBQmp6ThmvzX5hD43wm6b33Kto1ACe-EKlpJO6znjMaAuWCEALw_wcB)  
  - [Island Farm Fresh](https://islandfarmfresh.com/)
  
- **Color Palette**:
  - **Primary Color**: Forest Green (#2E8B57) – symbolizes health, freshness, and nature.
  - **Neutral Color**: Warm Beige (#F5F5DC) – provides a clean, welcoming look without overpowering.
  - **Highlight Color**: Bright Tomato Red (#FF6347) – adds a fresh, eye-catching accent for important elements.

- **Fonts**:  
  I will use **Lora** and **Poppins**. These variable fonts create a welcoming feel and help reduce the website’s load time.
