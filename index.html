                How We grow
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our farm runs on a best practice system, we use a combination of management that ensures our produce is the highest quality possible. We are not currently certified organic but we do grow all produce and vegetables organically. Through the use of mechanical and cultural management we keep our farm pests under control. Black plastic mulch, flame weeders, roto-tiller and old fashion weeding techniques are used to keep encroaching weeds down. Row covers help to keep insect pests out of our susceptible crops and a good crop rotation plan ensures that we are keeping pests at a minimum from season to season. Fertility is managed here by adding well composted cattle manure as well as our own manure produced by our laying hen flock. Supplemental organic fertilizer is added as needed to our drip irrigation system throughout the season.
